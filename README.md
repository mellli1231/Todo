# Todo-List

<p>For this project, I made a <a href = "https://mellli1231.github.io/Todo/">Todo list website</a> that helps you keep track of the daily goals in life, and even long term goals.
You are able to enter a task you want to complete, which will then be added to the list below. Upon completion of your tasks, you are able to then remove
them and work towards your other goals. This Todo list is presented with visuals appealing to current online aesthetic trends, and includes the following features: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>toggle between dark mode and light mode</li>
  <li>entering tasks with the enter button or enter key</li>
  <li>save the task or cancel the edits</li>
  <li>present the current date</li>
</ul>

<p>This is my first web project and I was able to learn a lot about web design with HTML and CSS. This has also introduced me to JavaScript and is my first project using all three languages! 
I am hoping to transform this website into a app that is able to add the following features: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>toggle between different colour themes</li>
  <li>due dates for tasks</li>
  <li>sound effects for buttons</li>
</ul>
