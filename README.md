# Todo-List

For this project, I made a Todo list website that includes the following features:
- toggle between dark mode and light mode
- entering tasks with the enter button or enter key
- save the task or cancel the edits

This is my first web project and I was able to learn a lot about web design with HTML and CSS. This has also introduced me to JavaScript and is my first project using all three languages! 
I am hoping to transform this website into a app that is able to add the following features:
- toggle between different colour themes
- due dates for tasks
- sound effects for buttons
